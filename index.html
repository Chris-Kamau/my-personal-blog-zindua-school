                <p>The title “Father” comes with a lifetime of responsibilities, hard work and sacrifices. A father is a protector, a provider, the voice of reason; a guy who wears many hats. It is hard to be a father and a parent, and sometimes the hardships can harden the man.

We obviously do not need to, but we want to.</p>
